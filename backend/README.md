# AWS Serverless Example

# Backend Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the backend of the serverless architecture project using AWS services.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with deployment, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **AWS Account**: Sign up for an AWS account if you haven't already.
   
2. **AWS Console Configuration**:
   - Log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
   - Familiarize yourself with the console layout and services you'll be using.
   
3. **AWS CLI Installation and Configuration**:
   - Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your local machine. You can download and install it from the [AWS CLI installation page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).
   - Configure AWS CLI with your AWS credentials by running `aws configure` and providing your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and output format. If you don't have credentials, follow the next step to create an IAM user.

4. **IAM User Configuration**:
   - Navigate to the IAM service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Create a new IAM user with programmatic access.
   - Attach policies to the IAM user based on the permissions required for your serverless application (e.g., AWSLambdaFullAccess, AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess).
   - Take note of the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key provided for the IAM user.

5. **Serverless Framework Installation**:
   - Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already. You can download and install them from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Install the Serverless Framework globally by running:
     ```bash
     npm install -g serverless
     ```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   
2. **Install Dependencies**

shell
    npm install
   
3. **Configuration**

    - Configure your AWS credentials locally using AWS CLI or set them up in the deployment script/environment.
    - Modify any configuration files (serverless.yml, template.yaml, etc.) as needed, such as specifying AWS region, IAM roles, or Lambda function settings.

4. **Deploy Backend**

    - If using Serverless Framework:
    
       shell
        serverless deploy
       
5. **Testing**

    - Once the deployment is successful, test your backend thoroughly to ensure all functionalities are working as expected.
    - Test different endpoints, Lambda functions, and integrations to verify the functionality.
