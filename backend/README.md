# AWS Serverless Example

# Backend Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the backend of the serverless architecture project using AWS services.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with deployment, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and manage AWS resources.
- AWS CLI installed and configured with access keys for the desired AWS account.
- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.
- (Optional) Serverless Framework installed globally for easier deployment.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   shell
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
   
2. **Install Dependencies**

   shell
    npm install
   
3. **Configuration**

    - Configure your AWS credentials locally using AWS CLI or set them up in the deployment script/environment.
    - Modify any configuration files (serverless.yml, template.yaml, etc.) as needed, such as specifying AWS region, IAM roles, or Lambda function settings.

4. **Deploy Backend**

    - If using Serverless Framework:
    
       shell
        serverless deploy
       
5. **Testing**

    - Once the deployment is successful, test your backend thoroughly to ensure all functionalities are working as expected.
    - Test different endpoints, Lambda functions, and integrations to verify the functionality.
